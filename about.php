    <p class="mt-2" id="columns">One score and 1 year ago blah blah blah Brett got Borned and he really liked frogs and had a dog named Bandit. Then he moved and he moved again and his daddy got into real estate and sold a bunch of houses and started some projects but never finsihed them and Brett had to do it but it turns out he really liked it. So when Brett got to high school he did a bunch of work in architecture and he was actually really good at it and won like 7 different awards for the states best home designs. Out of high school Brett got his builder's liccense and committed himeslf to busting his butt becasue he likes doing it. Somewhere in there he designed a pond in his back yard.</p>

        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Derrick:</span> My wife and I love Brett so much we just hand him our keys and say get to work. We expect him back at any one of our 4 houses every morning, and he will work until I got home to tell him to stop all the banging and drilling. Sometimes I just watch him work. He's done a bang up job on several of my houses and I was able to sell my previous home thanks to his bathroom renovations. Damnit Brett!</p>
